# ðŸŽ¯ HTB Junior Cybersecurity Analyst â†’ Red Teamer + Blue Team Foundations

> Note: always operate **legally and ethically**. Only test systems and networks you own or have explicit written permission to test.

---

## Quick context
Youâ€™re completing the **Hack The Box â€” Junior Cybersecurity Analyst** path. This roadmap blends that analyst foundation into two career directions:
- **Red Team** (offensive) â€” adversary emulation, pen-testing, exploitation, AD attacks, C2
- **Blue Team** (defensive) â€” detection, incident response, DFIR, SIEM & EDR operations

Suggested timeline: **6â€“12 months** (flexible). Use HTB boxes and TryHackMe labs to practice both sides.

- [ ] When practicing C2 or offensive tooling, always isolate to your lab and never run on the public internet without permission.

---

## Suggested mini-projects (portfolio & learning)
- [ ] Full HTB box write-up (enumeration â†’ exploitation â†’ post-exploit) + detection notes for defenders
- [ ] AD chain-of-exploit lab with mitigation notes (show both attack steps and detection queries)
- [ ] Create 3 Sigma rules or SIEM searches to detect the behaviors you used in a lab attack
- [ ] Small C2 implant demo in a controlled lab (document detection & mitigation)

---

### TL;DR â€” How to prioritise
1. Finish HTB Junior Cybersecurity Analyst boxes â†’ build confidence.  
2. Master networking, Linux, Windows fundamentals.  
3. Alternate offensive and defensive practice: for every attack lab, write detection rules and a response playbook.  
4. Focus on AD attacks and DFIR skills (both are high-value).  
5. Build write-ups and a portfolio showing *both* how you attack and how you detect/defend.  
6. Pick entry certs (eJPT / Security+ / CySA+) then progress to OSCP / advanced DFIR quals as needed.
